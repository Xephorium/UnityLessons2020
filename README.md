# Unity Sandbox
The first step on two brothers' journey toward building our own universe.

### Project Archival
As of February 2021, Sandbox has been ported to Unreal Engine 4. Its development will continue in our [new repository](https://github.com/Xephorium/Sandbox) with the more mature toolset. This version of the project will remain as an archive of the lessons we learned while building in Unity.

### Resources & Credits
